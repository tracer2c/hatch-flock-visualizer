# SPA fallback for client-side routing
# Netlify-style redirects: send all paths to index.html
# If your host ignores this file, the 404.html we include will handle fallback.
# Syntax: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/

# The following line ensures all routes render the SPA
# Route all requests to index.html
# The 200 status tells the host it's a rewrite, not a redirect
